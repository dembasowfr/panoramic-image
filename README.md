## Overview:
This project is a simple implementation of Panoramic Image Stitching using OpenCV and Python. The project is implemented using the following steps:
1. Feature Detection
2. Feature Matching
3. Homography Estimation
4. Image Warping
5. Image Blending


## Requirements:
1. Python 3.6 or above
2. OpenCV
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlib

## Usage:


1. Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the code:
```bash
python ./src/main.py
```

## Results:
The results of the project can be found in the `data` directory. The results include the stitched image and the intermediate results of the project.
